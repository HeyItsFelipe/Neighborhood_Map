# Neighborhood Map

### How to run
To run Neighborhood Map, open index.html in the Chrome browser.  You should see a grey user panel on the upper left and a map covering most of the browser.
### How to use
Type where it says "Type Here" in the input panel.  This will search the list, located below the input panel, for matches.  This will also dynamically update the map and show map markers that match the list.

The map can be panned and zoomed.

Clicking on a marker will show links from Wikipedia about that location.
